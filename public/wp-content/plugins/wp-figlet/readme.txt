WP Figlet allows you to draw ASCII art in your posts and page source.


== Description ==

WP Figlet allows you to draw ASCII art in your posts and page source.

Here is an example:

<pre>
                 __                 __                 
|  |  _   _  _| |__)  _  _  _  _   |__)  _   _ |   _ | 
|/\| (_) |  (_| |    |  (- _) _)   | \  (_) (_ |( _) . 
</pre>


You can use ASCII art to say a personal message about your site. Or it can say an advertisement. 

This can be especially true for web design or development sites or if your site just plain rocks, as often people like to take a look at the page source to see how was something done or what plugins were used. This ads just a little extra touch of coolness that might persuade them to actually give you that call. Of course there are ton’s of fonts and you can customize is the way you want.

== Credits ==

WP Figlet is based on Figlet (www.figlet.org) and Figlet PHP class (www.thebobo.com), the classical ASCII art program.

Thanks.

== Installation ==
